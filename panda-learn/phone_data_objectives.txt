Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and display the first 5 rows.

Check the basic information about the dataset (data types, non-null counts).

Display the summary statistics of numerical columns.

Count the number of unique values in each column.

Find the total number of calls made in the dataset.

Calculate the total duration of all calls combined.

Count how many SMS messages were sent.

Find the most frequently used mobile network.

Calculate the average duration of calls.

Identify the month with the highest number of communications.

Group the data by 'network' and calculate the total duration for each network.

Find the day with the highest number of calls.(baki)

Calculate the percentage of data usage vs calls vs SMS.

Create a new column 'call_type' that categorizes calls as 'short' (<1 min), 'medium' (1-5 min), or 'long' (>5 min).

Calculate the average call duration for each network provider.

Find the network with the highest average call duration.

Count how many communications occurred on each date.

Calculate the total duration of communications for each day.

Find the most active hour of communication (assuming all occurred at same time for this dataset).

Create a pivot table showing the count of each item type (call, sms, data) per network.

Calculate the rolling 2-day average of call durations.

Identify any anomalies in call durations (values beyond 3 standard deviations from mean).

Create a new DataFrame that shows the count and total duration of each item type per month.

Calculate the cumulative sum of call durations over time.

Find the longest continuous sequence of calls from the same network.

Calculate the time difference between consecutive communications (requires datetime conversion).

Create a function to categorize days as "high activity" or "low activity" based on number of communications.

Calculate the network that was used most for each type of communication (call, sms, data).

Find the ratio of outgoing calls to SMS messages for each network.

Create a summary DataFrame that shows for each network: total calls, total SMS, total duration, and average duration.
